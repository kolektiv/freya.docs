Types
=====

Freya is driven by a strongly-typed approach to working with the web, and so includes a set of libraries (**Freya.Types.***) which model many of the constructs found in web specifications, particularly those dealing with HTTP, URIs, etc. These libraries were previously known as the Arachne project, but were brought under the Freya umbrella in the 3.0 release.
