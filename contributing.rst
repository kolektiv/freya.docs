Contributing
============

Contributions to Freya in any form are very welcome. Whether you just want to correct some grammar in the documentation (!) or you'd like to contribute a new feature, you can feel comfortable that the Freya project will treat you with gratitude and with respect.

.. hint::

   If you're not comfortable with GitHub (or Git in general) or you're not familiar or comfortable with any of the processes mentioned below, don't worry. If you contact a maintainer by Email or on Twitter, they'll help you through anything that you need -- everybody needs a helping hand sometimes and nobody knows everything!

Documentation
-------------

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, the quickest way is to use the "Edit on GitHub" link at the top of any page -- that'll allow you to edit any content and send a pull request easily.

Although it's very likely that you're help will be accepted without any issue, if you're planning on making major changes to the structure or content of Freya documentation it's probably worth discussing it first. Please get in contact via one of the channels below.

Code
----

As with documentation, the quickest way to contribute is to create a fork on GitHub and submit a pull request. You are also welcome to log issues if you'd like to suggest features, report bugs, or make sure anything else relevant gets noted.

Also as with documentation, if you're planning on putting significant effort in to a feature or change, please get in contact first, to make sure that it's likely to be accepted in to Freya -- and to make sure it's not already being worked on!

Contact
