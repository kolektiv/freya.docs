Reference
=========

Reference documentation for Freya contains guides to specific libraries along with guides for using Freya as part of a larger system. These are technical guides and give an overview of general use, rather than a recipe-like approach. The reference documentation is designed to be referred to when you're using Freya.

The reference documentation is divided in to two sections:

* :doc:`libraries/index` -- contains reference information for the libraries (and sets of libraries) that go to make up Freya itself. This covers the complete set of Freya functionality, and gives a good reference to use when following tutorials and other guidance on Freya.
* :doc:`integration/index` -- contains information on integrating Freya with the other elements of the web ecosystem such as servers and other web frameworks (one of the features of Freya is that it can integrate seamlessly with most other common components of a .NET web architecture).

When you're looking for more general information on how to work in Freya, and how to think about solving problems using Freya, you might want to look at some of the other documentation options, particularly:

* Topics -- for focused guides to areas of development with Freya.
* Recipes -- for Freya-based solutions to common problems.
