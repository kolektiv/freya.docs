Polyfills
=========

Polyfills provide functionality which is not (and may never be) part of an open standard. Existing polyfills add existing data to the OWIN standard, enabling such things as more accurate routing. Polyfills are available for the following servers:

* :doc:`katana` -- polyfills for Katana-based implementations, including self-hosted and IIS hosted approaches.
* :doc:`kestrel` -- polyfills for Kestrel-based servers.
