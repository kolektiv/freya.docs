Conventions
===========

Freya Machines follow a package naming convention to make it clear what is available and how it should be used. The convention for naming is as follows:

* **Freya.Machines.<Machine>[.<Extension>]**

Using the example of the Freya HTTP Machine, this gives:

* **Freya.Machines.Http**

as the name of the core HTTP Machine library. The HTTP Machine also has extensions available to implement further web standards. Following the convention, this gives:

* **Freya.Machines.Http.Cors**
* **Freya.Machines.Http.Patch**
