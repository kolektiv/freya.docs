Machines
========

Freya provides powerful ways to interact with the web which are safe, expressive, and relatively low-level. However, Freya also provides some higher level abstractions to enable more effective and concise programming when interacting with complex standards.

Machines are one way of approaching this, and provide a different model of web programming, based around decision trees and declarative programming (don't worry -- this sounds complex and scary, but it isn't!)

Freya currently includes one machine (with extensions) for working with HTTP -- additions may be made in future for complementary protocols, etc.

* :doc:`http/index` -- a Freya Machine for working with HTTP in a safe and semantically correct way, based on a purely functional declarative approach.
